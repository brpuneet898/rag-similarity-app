Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. These models, such as GPT and BERT, leverage massive datasets and billions of parameters to perform tasks like summarization, translation, and question answering. The scalability of LLMs allows them to generalize across various domains, making them versatile tools for businesses and researchers. However, challenges such as hallucinations, ethical misuse, and computational demands pose significant hurdles. LLMs represent a significant milestone in AI development, enabling more interactive and natural human-computer interactions. Future advancements aim to address their limitations and enhance their applicability.
